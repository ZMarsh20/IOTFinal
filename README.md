# IOTFinal
Recreated the heads up game on Arduino with base station and tkinter in python

FinalHeadsUp.ino is for the Arduino
BaseStation.py is to be run first with xbee radio via usb opening on the port of that usb, in this case COM4
main.py to be run next. Arduino must be up and running before clicking start game or it will fail
words.db is just a database with words with an associated category attached. Made this one without much care for quality
